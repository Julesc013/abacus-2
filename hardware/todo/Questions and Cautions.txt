Use opcodes the same as Intel 8086/MOS 6502 so that we can just reuse the assembler?

When design computer, watch out for propagation delays and power supply issues... Follow guides on reddit, use lots of capacitors.
Ask electrical engineering:
What's the maximum speed I can run it at?
What effect will using the edge connectors have?
